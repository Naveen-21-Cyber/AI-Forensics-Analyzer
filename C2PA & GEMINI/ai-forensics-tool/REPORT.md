# AI Image Forensics Tool - Technical Report

**Project Status:** Completed & Deployed
**Version:** 1.0.0 (Enterprise Edition)
**Date:** 2026-01-31

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This project successfully delivered a **professional, enterprise-grade AI Image Forensics Tool**. The system is designed to detect synthetic (AI-generated) media and deepfakes using a multi-modal analysis approach (Metadata, Pixel Forensics, Frequency Analysis).

The final product features a **modern SaaS-style UI**, mobile-first responsiveness, and a robust verification backend capable of deep EXIF extraction and PDF reporting.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend (Client-Side)
-   **Core Tech**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript. No heavy frameworks (React/Vue) used to ensure lightweight performance.
-   **Modules**:
    -   `metadata.js`: Parses EXIF and C2PA provenance data.
    -   `pixel_analysis.js`: Performs Noise Variance Estimation and Error Level Analysis (ELA) simulation.
    -   `frequency.js`: Implements Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect GAN-generated grid artifacts.
    -   `scoring.js`: Weighted confidence filtering engine.
    -   `ui.js`: Handles DOM manipulation and visualizations.

### 2.2 Backend (Server-Side)
-   **Framework**: Python **Flask** (Microservice architecture).
-   **Key Libraries**:
    -   `Pillow (PIL)`: Image processing and deep EXIF/Lens data extraction.
    -   `numpy`: Numerical computations for variance analysis.
    -   `fpdf2`: Professional PDF report generation.
-   **Endpoints**:
    -   `/api/analyze`: Server-side verification (ELA + Metadata).
    -   `/api/report`: Generates downloadable forensic reports.

## 3. Key Features Delivered

### 🔍 Deep Forensics
1.  **Metadata Inspection**: Detects software signatures (e.g., "Adobe Photoshop", "Midjourney") and **Content Credentials (C2PA)**.
2.  **ELA (Error Level Analysis)**: Highlights areas of an image that have different compression levels, indicating potential tampering.
3.  **FFT Spectrum**: Visualizes frequency domain anomalies often left by generative adversarial networks (GANs).

### 📱 Responsive "SaaS" Design
-   **Aesthetic**: "Zinc & Slate" monochromatic theme with glassmorphism accents.
-   **Mobile Integration**: Fully optimized for touch devices using CSS Grid/Flexbox media queries.
-   **Interactive**: Staggered animations, drag-and-drop file handling, and dynamic gauge charts.

### 📄 Professional Reporting
-   **PDF Export**: Evidence-grade reports containing the analyzed image, timestamp, integrity score, and final verdict.
-   **Server Verification**: Double-checks client-side results with server-grade libraries for maximum reliability.

## 4. Deployment Guide

### PythonAnywhere (Recommended)
1.  **Upload**: Copy all files (`app.py`, `templates/`, `static/`) to the host.
2.  **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  **WSGI Config**: Point the web worker to `app.py`.

### Local Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

## 5. Future Roadmap
-   **Deep Learning Models**: Integrate a ResNet50 classifier for higher-accuracy AI detection.
-   **Cloud Storage**: S3 integration for long-term report archiving.
-   **User Accounts**: Login system for forensic teams.
